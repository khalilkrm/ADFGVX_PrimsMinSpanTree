# ADFGVX Cryography performance test and Prim's minimum spanning tree in a maze

### src/crypto package
#### Efficiently encrypts and decrypts using the ADFGVX method in the shortest time possible.
In cryptography, the ADFGVX cipher was a manually applied field cipher used by the Imperial German Army during World War I. It was used to transmit messages secretly using wireless telegraphy.
### src/spanning
#### Determines the most direct route to exit a maze. Using prim's minimum spanning tree.
Prim's algorithm (also known as Jarn√≠k's algorithm) is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.
